              <p><i>Explosions of colour and paper are scattered about the tables. Splashes of bright paints mark the group’s hands as they pause between strokes of paint to look critically at their work. While some brief spurts of chuckling can be heard amongst the group, a quick glance around the room sees faces with creased brows of concern peering at their vibrant pieces of art. No, these are not children in an art class; these are fully fledged adults, painting mandalas at a wellness retreat.</i></p>

<p>It seems every second person in the world is ascending on a health reboot by attending yoga and wellness retreats-or at least that’s how I feel scrolling through my Instagram feed each morning. Whether you are specifically following yoga accounts or you’re aimlessly scrolling through the suggested feed, chances are you will come across photos of groups of people balancing on their heads or peacefully meditating atop scenic mountains.</p>

<p>So are these wellness retreats all they’re cracked up to be in Instagram photos? Will shedding out hundreds of dollars for a weekend of yoga, therapy like group activities and mandala painting do any good? I knew experiencing this all first hand would be the only way to tell.</p>

<p>To dip my toes into the world of wellness retreats, I chose a two-day package hosted at the Springvale Botanical Cemetery. Yes, a cemetery. Mourners donning full black attire aside, the setting was stunning. The chilly air produced constant shivering from my lycra clad body when we ventured on garden walks, but the seas of brilliantly coloured roses were a welcome distraction.</p>

<p>Our day began in a warm room filled with natural light and multi coloured yoga mats strewn across the floor. Around 15 of us made our way to stand on our chosen mats, the sticky sound of bare feet on soft plastic filling the moments of silence.</p>
<br>
<p>“Please find a place of stillness on your mat,” the instructor began. Immediately I tugged at my tight leggings and fidgeted at the mention of stillness.</p>

<p>Arms placed by my side in mountain pose, I breathed in…and out. The harmonious hum of synchronized breathing was both peaceful and somewhat jarring; eyes closed, it’s as if we were alone with our own thoughts, and then suddenly the warmth of other bodies and the instructor’s voice leading us into a change of pose reminded me I was involved in a group activity.</p>

 It should be said, I have never been a fan of meditation and slow movements. If I had a preference I would choose Vinyasa yoga; flowing sequences, faster transitions through poses and a whole lot more sweat. However, I came to the conclusion the idea of a retreat is to remove one’s self from the everyday, and participate in things which aid in this process. And thus I attended a retreat based on healing, meditation and anxiety relief, in lieu of fitness fuelled activities.</p>

<p>The yoga organiser at this retreat was Nick Grimsdale; a yoga teacher at the renowned KX yoga studio. As well as independently assisting and consulting for humble sized retreats as the one hosted at the Springvale Botanical Cemetery, Grimsdale is also well versed in the likes of week long retreats situated in exotic destinations like Bali. A quick scroll through his Instagram, (@another_yogi) will display rows and rows of photos of him in pretzel like shapes; poses we did not learn to achieve at the weekend retreat.</p>

<p>Like many health trends, it is hard to pinpoint the exact reason why attending these retreats has become so popular. But to Grimsdale, it’s like the “100th monkey effect”.</p>

<p>Matter-of-factly he stated, “everyone starts to see the benefits, and hops on board”.</p>

<p>“More and more people are wanting a healthier lifestyle, and wanting to nurture both their body and spirit in the presence of other like minded individuals.”</p>

<p>But why retreats, you might add. Is it not just another example of a superficial yoga fad to get lululemon attired white girls swept up in the hype?</p>

<p>Grimsdale, of course would not agree with that statement, but he does admit, “contemporary yoga, is not very reflective of the original yoga”.</p>

<p>However, the professional yogi firmly believes “for our modern life style (contemporary yoga) is a wonderful middle ground. It does not have to be a spiritual practice; it can just be a practice that supports your wellbeing.”</p>

<p>Admittedly, I had been very eager to attend a wellness retreat. The picturesque snapshots of yogis flowing through a yoga practice together or sitting in circles in group meditation was something so novel and almost utopian to someone like me who practices in isolation.</p>

<p>So was it too good to be true? A little yes, a little no. While I enjoyed every aspect of the weekend; group yoga, meditation, mandala making and group therapy, there were definitely some things I savoured more than others.</p>

<p>According to Michal deWilloughby, organiser of the Springvale Botanic Cemetery retreat, this is not an uncommon experience.  She said, “we get feed back that not all the activities were beneficial, but you can’t please everyone all the time”.</p>

<p>“Some thought there had to be an outcome that looked a certain way. Perhaps they were overthinking the whole process or they had an idea of what a wellness retreat would look like.”</p>

<p>During the group aspects of the weekend, it was difficult not to compare yourself to others. With my block coloured, pink and blue mandala laid out in front of me, flashes of other participant’s work caught my attention.  Intricately, hand-drawn motifs were the focal point of some, while other’s charms emanated from personal touches such as the scrawling of a loved-one’s name or of meaningful quotes. I just wanted mine to look pretty, but I doubt this was the purpose of the exercise.
If the prospect of not being good enough at art was daunting for me, then one can only imagine how apprehensive some may feel going to yoga retreats, expectedly filled with more experienced yogis than themselves. One quick visit to the yoga hashtag on Instagram will have any yoga novice running for the hills as filtered images of yogis performing perfect asanas (poses) and tricks inundate your vision. The notion of attempting to join the ranks of such people can become altogether too intimidating.</p>

<p>Yoga therapist, teacher and all round authentic human, Georgia Hicks, is all about being genuine and honest; through her teaching and her Instagram page (@yogawithgeorgia). I discovered her through the latter. While Hicks’ photos primarily feature her upside down and balancing on her hands, each caption is both inviting and helpful to yoga novices, who could be intimidated by her skill and strength.</p>

<p>“It can be discouraging for beginners when there is such a strong saturation of 'perfect' Yogis pictured in the public,” said Hicks. “As with anything, it is important to have balance and context”. </p>

<p>“This is why I believe honesty and transparency is very important so we know the story behind the picture. I try to always give an honest representation of my yoga journey through my social media so that I do not lead people on.”</p>

<p>So you’re no longer dreading sharing a space with other yogis- you’re fear of judgment is no longer clouding your decision making, but is it still worth it to go on a retreat? Hicks says yes.</p>

<p>According to Hicks, your physical health and wellbeing is worth the money. Will a DIY meditation session at home do the trick? It would help, but the physical aspect of leaving your daily life could actually aid in relieving your mind from daily stresses as well.</p>

<p>“Sometimes it is helpful for people to have time out from their normal routine to break bad habits and make a solid commitment to improving themselves.” Says Hicks.</p>

<p>“For this reason, I believe wellness retreats can be really transformative for some people. It can be difficult to create such a big change within your normal life, but of course, not impossible.”</p>

<p>Since the weekend retreat I have tried to practice meditative and restorative yoga poses each night, before bed. In downward dog, my hamstrings resist the stretch and beg to released, lying in shavasana I want to make a to-do list and ponder over life’s problems, but I do it anyway. It’s doubtful anyone would say their life has been drastically altered one way or the other by attending a wellness retreat, but it does change something. Whether you pick up another form of yoga, discover your love for meditation, or find satisfaction in creating a mandala, a retreat will teach you a thing or two. And even if you resented the entire experience, take heed in that you’ll never have to go to another- it’ll leave you with a few extra hundred (or thousand) dollars in your bank account at the very least.</p>
